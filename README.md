# NOTE:

Development of the Hydra NGSI-LD broker has been stopped. We no longer provide the source code or any support. 

The main goal of the Hydra project was always to get started with learning/understanding the NGSI-LD API through practical implementation. This goal has been achieved.

However, this doesn't mean that GeoNet.MRN has given up on the goal of developing its own NGSI-LD broker. Quite the contrary: We take this goal more serious than ever. 

We have switched the programming language from Python to TypeScript (compiling to JavaScript, running in Node.js) and started a new code base with many very significant improvements. We call this new, much more serious and complete NGSI-LD broker "Cassiopeia".

Like Hydra, Cassiopeia is still far from complete, but we are confident that we can achieve full implementation of the NGSI-LD standard in the not too distant future. At this point at the latest, we will publish Cassipeia as open source just like we did with Hydra. Possibly even much earlier.
